  <h1 id="8/18/16">August 18th, 2016 - One Week Until Classes!</h1>
  <p>Summer is almost over, can you believe it? I can't!</p>
  <p>With the end of the summer comes the end of my internship at UBS.</p>
  <p>The Fall 2016 semester at Baruch may start next Thursday, but my first CTP class is this Tuesday! I'm really excited to get started.</p>
  <p>I know it's been a while since my last blog post, but I'll try to write more as the year goes on. The whole world will get to hear about this upcoming semester.</p>
  <p>I've decided to add a "Cheap Eats Recommendation" section to the blog. Each post I'll include a great, cheap place to eat at that I've been to recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2 class="CheapEats">This post's (and the first) Cheap Eats Recommendation:</h2>
  <p><strong>Gowanus Yacht Club</strong></p>
  <p><strong><a href="http://maps.apple.com/?address=323+Smith+Street,+Brooklyn+NY"><u>323 Smith Street, Brooklyn, NY 11231</u></a></strong></p>
  <p>Get the $2 hotdog or the $6 burger (add an extra dollar or two for add-ons) made on their small backyard-style grill. Make sure you get an order of pickes too ($2). They also have various sausages that I have yet to try. It's a small place, but I like small places without music so I can hear what my friends are saying. The best part? It's outside.</p>
  <p>Get over there now because the cold weather will be here before we know it!</p>

  <h1 id="7/14/16">My First Post - July 14<sup>th</sup>, 2016</h1>
  <p>Hi everyone! Happy Bastile Day to all of my fellow French people out there!</p>
  <p>This past Tuesday, July 12<sup>th</sup>, we had our second meeting of CUNY Tech Prep. Part of our homework for the next six weeks is to build a website. Well here it is! Hope everyone likes it!</p>
  <p>I actually decided to spend a lot of time yesterday working on this website because, believe it or not, I've been enjoying working on this so much. It's obviously still a work in progress because there's so much I'm trying to learn, and once I finish with the content, I'll need to step away for a bit so I can judge the design with rested eyes.</p>
  <p>As for what I'm going to do with this blog: Well, I've never actually blogged before. Maybe I'll add pictures of something fun I've seen or done whenever I write a post. I'm open to suggestions if you think this is boring.</p>
