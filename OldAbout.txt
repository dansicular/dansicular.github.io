   <p>I'm going to use this page to allow you to get to know me better</p>
    <p>I was born in New York City 22 long years ago</p>
    <p>My mom and I moved to Fair Lawn, NJ (right nearby), when I was 5, then we moved back to NYC after I finished high school</p>

    <br />
    <p>Right after graduating high school, I decided to take my talents to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor</p>

    <br />

    <p>I decided to join the Zeta Psi fraternity during the second semester of the Freshmen year</p>

    <p>No matter what you read and hear about fraternities online, it was, by far and away, the best decision I made in college</p>

    <p>See if you can find me in the picture</p>
    <p>I lived in that house for about a year and half and I enjoyed every minute of it</p>

    <br />
    <br />

    <p>Unfortunately, midway through my junior year, I caught a very bad case of mono</p>
    <p>I had to withdraw from school, come home, and recover for a year</p>

    <br />

    <p>While recovering, I decided to stay in New York to finish college</p>
    <p>I really only considered one school</p>

    <br />

    <p>I fell in love with tbe curriculum combining statistics, tech, and business</p>
    <p>Almost immediately, I declared as a Statistics and Quantitative Modeling major and as an Economics minor</p>
    <p>I have nothing but great things to say about my professors and the coursework</p>

    <h3>But school isn't my whole life!</h3>

    <br />
    <br />

    <h3>So outside of school...</h3>

    <p>...I love long walks along NYC's rivers</p>

    <h3>Okay Dan, so tell us why you decided to apply to CUNY Tech Prep</h3>
    <p>A representative from the program came and spoke to my club, Hack For Baruch, about it</p>
    <p>When it comes to coding, though I did extremely well in my Object Oriented Programming class, I'm basically a novice, so I thought that this program would give me an opportunity to learn more, especially because I actually enjoyed studying for the class</p>
    <p>I'm extremely excited to meet all of the extremely bright people in this program, along with exploring the professional and networking opportunities available to us!</p>
